# Group 3, Project 6 README 

Overview/Purpose
Our project focuses on BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) station crime data. By organizing crime data by the station each crime/police report occured at, we found we could give riders or potential riders insight into the station they want to depart from or arrive to. The purpose of this is to inform the public of safety concerns both historically and (ideally) in real time.
