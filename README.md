# Group 3, Project 6 README 

Overview/Purpose
Our project focuses on BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) station crime data. By organizing crime data by the station each crime/police report occured at, we found we could give riders or potential riders insight into the station they want to depart from or arrive to. The purpose of this is to inform the public of safety concerns both historically and (ideally) in real time. 

Instructions on Use and Interaction

Ethical Considerations
The main ethical consideration in our project pertains to personally identifiable information (PII). Our crime report data set includes race, gender, and birth date, which can cause in andividual's identity to be found or information used without their permission. This information should be removed or anonymized, and access to the data set should be controlled and/or limited. The purpose of using this data set is not to be able to identify certain individuals, but to provide general safety alerts/knowledge to the public riding BART.

Additionally, our project uses BART police and transportation data for educational purposes only. If we wanted to actually create this application outside of the classroom, it would be neccesary to at least get copyright permissions for data sources, API documentation, and BART logos etc.
